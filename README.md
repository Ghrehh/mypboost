# Setup

Clone the repo to your machine, navigate to the directory and install the necessary files using npm:

`npm i`

Run the development server and builder using:

`npm run dev`

You should now be able to navigate to "localhost:7676" and see the app running. Any changes you make should trigger a rebuild automatically.

# Tests and Linting

Run tests with:

`npm test`

Or run tests automatically on file changes with:

`npm run test:watch`

Run the linter with:

`npm run lint`
